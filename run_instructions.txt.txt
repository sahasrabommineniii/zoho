Hello,

I have written codes for login and signup pages. I was able to create backend for the contacts application.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Get Node modules and you can run - npm start in the loginp folder to check the working of signup pages.

To check the contact application :

1.You need to create a folder in your C drive for this - data/db

2.Start mongodb connection in cmd (run as admin) -
C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="c:\data"

3. Open a node cmd and cd to contactlist and write 'nodemon'

4. Open a second node cmd and cd to contactlist and write 'npm start'

NOTE:
To check working through Postman: localhost/3000/contacts to retrieve data and localhost/3000/contact to push data.

Following the above instrutions you can check the working of my code.


Thank you,
Sahasra B.
